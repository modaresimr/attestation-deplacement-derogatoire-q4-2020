To avoid retyping everytime, data will be saved in the brower. 

## Autofill
This proposed version allows you to pass the fields to be filled in as parameters of the URL, just select the reason and generate your attestation normally.
What is proposed here is in no way intended to cheat / circumvent anything, but to allow the filling of fixed data more quickly (via bookmark or NFC tag for example).

example url:
```
http://modaresimr.github.io/attestation-deplacement-derogatoire-q4-2020/?firstname=prenom&lastname=nom&birthday=01/01/1970&placeofbirth=Paris&address=1 Avenue de Paris&city=Paris&zipcode=75000
```
